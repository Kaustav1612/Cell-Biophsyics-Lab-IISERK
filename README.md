# Cell-Biophsyics-Lab-IISERK
These scripts are written during my masters in IISER K at Cell Biophysics Lab, primarily related to cell imaging object detection and object tracking and bit of membrane simulation.

These scripts are written for a particular kind of analysis work, however these scripts can be tweaked to be used in all kinds of biological imaging techniques

For any assistance feel free to contact me
